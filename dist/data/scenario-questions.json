    "scenario": "A global e-commerce platform is rolling out a multi-currency payment gateway across North America, EMEA, and APAC. The initiative must support real-time FX rate updates, region-specific refund SLAs, and varying compliance rules (AML/KYC, PCI-DSS). Operations, Marketing, Compliance, Finance, and Regional Managers often interpret refund and notification rules differently, leading to inconsistent customer experiences and rework. The BA has to achieve alignment on terminology, policies, and service levels; model order/return workflows; manage trade-offs for performance targets (for example, refund turnaround time); and ensure traceability from business goals to implemented capabilities. Several country sites integrate with legacy tax and invoicing systems, and delivery partners expose different interface contracts. The program is delivered iteratively with design prototypes and frequent stakeholder reviews.",
